@class NMViewLayoutManager;


/**
 * The NMView class allows the creation of custom UIView subclasses using nib
 * files to specify the layout of the view.
 *
 * Typically, when creating UIView subclasses, the view's appearance and its
 * subview hierarchy have to be assembled in code. This can become tedious and
 * is prone to error. With NMView, you design your view's layout using IB, save
 * the layout in a nib file and load the view with its layout during its
 * initialization.
 *
 * ## View layouts using nib files
 *
 * NMView provides a default implementation of the -loadViewWithNibName:bundle:
 * method which is used to load the view's layout from a nib file. The
 * implementation relies on a special structure of the nib file which is
 * described in detail in the documentation of -loadViewWithNibName:bundle:.
 *
 * For initialization of your view in code, you can either use the regular
 * -initWithFrame: method or the -initWithNibName:bundle: method. If the view is
 * initialized as part of a nib loading process (eg. when the view is added as
 * a subview to a UIViewController's view hierarchy in the view controller's nib
 * file), the -initWithCoder: method is used to initialize the view.
 *
 * Each of the initialization methods try to load the view's layout from a nib
 * file using -loadViewWithNibName:bundle:. The -initWithFrame: and
 * -initWithCoder: methods try to load the nib by passing nil for the nib name
 * and nil for the bundle, the -initWithNibName:bundle: method passes its
 * argument values to -loadViewWithNibName:bundle:. Passing nil / nil will try
 * to load a nib with the class name's name from the main bundle.
 *
 * If NMView cannot load the view from a nib (either because there is no
 * matching nib file or because the nib's structure does not fit the loading
 * process), it will call the -createView method as a last resort for creating
 * the view's layout programmatically. Therefore, even when creating your view's
 * layout in code, subclassing from NMView can make sense since -createView is
 * called regardless of the initializer used to create the instance.
 *
 * After the view has been loaded (either from a nib or using -createView), the
 * -viewDidLoad method is called. You can override the method in your custom
 * NMView subclass to perform some post-processing work that cannot be performed
 * in Interface Builder.
 *
 * One obvious thing to point out: since NMView (and its subclasses) directly
 * inherits from UIView, its view is loaded during initialization for the whole
 * lifetime of the instance. This is in contrast to a
 * UIViewController where the controller can exist without the associated view
 * (ie. -initWithNibName:bundle: on UIViewController does *not* load the view).
 * Therefore, for NMView, -viewDidLoad is always called exactly once during the
 * lifetime of an NMView instance whereas a UIViewController's -viewDidLoad
 * might be called multiple times.
 *
 * ## Alternative layouts
 *
 * On top of loading the view's layout from a nib file, NMView also supports
 * alternative layouts that can be activated based on the current bounds of the
 * view. This allows, for example, for the creation of different layouts of the
 * same NMView subclass for portrait and landscape orientations that cannot be
 * implemented using regular view autoresizing.
 *
 * Layouts can either be activated manually using the -changeLayoutIfNecessary
 * method or can be changed automatically by setting the
 * automaticLayoutChangeEnabled property to YES. In that case, each call to
 * -layoutSubviews automatically calls -changeLayoutIfNecessary.
 *
 * Once a layout has been applied, the -layoutDidChange method is
 * called to allow the NMView subclass to perform some post-processing on the
 * new layout. In this method you can, for example, apply modifications to your
 * layout that you cannot define in IB (like change the transform of one of the
 * subviews).
 *
 * For NMView to be able to load alternative layouts, the layouts have to be
 * specified in the same nib that the view is loaded from. Next to the regular
 * view layout, the nib will have to include another top-level view of the exact
 * same hierarchy for each alternative layout. Using Interface Builder, the
 * subviews in the alternative layout can now be re-arranged (as long as their
 * hierarchy is kept in the same shape as the regular layout). Once done, the
 * top-level view's type of each alternative layout has to be changed to
 * NMViewLayoutView so that NMView can detect which of the views should be used
 * for alternative layouts and which views might serve a different purpose (like
 * being injected into IBOutlets of your view).
